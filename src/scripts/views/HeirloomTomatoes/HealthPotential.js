              2013: The Health Potential of the 'Real' Tomato
            </SectionHeading>

            <p>
              The Heritage Food Crops Research Trust is a very small charitable
              Trust in New Zealand that investigates the health properties of
              fruit and vegetables in order to find the very best medicinal
              foods for human health. To date, we have concentrated on apples,
              tomatoes and beans.
            </p>

            <p>
              We wish to find the truth about what foods are best for our
              health. The data we have gathered on tomatoes clearly shows some
              of the old heirloom varieties have substantially higher levels of
              beneficial compounds than modern hybrid varieties.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our direction has been influenced by our earlier work on apples,
              which indicated that there must be a flaw in modern breeding
              programmes whereby breeding criteria (and possibly other factors)
              led to lower levels of beneficial compounds in modern bred apples.
              Accordingly we have striven to find the oldest tomato varieties
              available anywhere in the world. Our work highlights the
              accelerated contamination of the gene pool that has happened in
              the past hundred years.

            <SectionSubheading>Tomatoes: the 'golden fruit'</SectionSubheading>

            <p>
              We are seven years into our tomato study. Our research on apples
              and tomatoes has shown the importance of heirloom (heritage) and
              old seedling varieties that contain much higher levels of
              beneficial compounds compared to modern, commercially bred
              varieties. For instance, within the wonderful diversity of
              colours, shapes and sizes of heirloom tomatoes, are a rich
              assortment of carotenoids and polyphenolic compounds. This
              includes varieties with good levels of specific medicinal
              compounds such as lycopene, recognised in a number of reputable
              studies to reduce the incidence of heart disease and certain
              cancers.
            </p>

            <p>
              In our search for the best medicinal tomato, we are trying to find
              a tomato that has retained the purity of its genetic blueprint
              over a considerable period of time; a variety that has not been
              changed through human manipulation. We believe that we have found
              just that in some heirloom orange tomatoes, varieties we think are
              closely linked to the 'golden fruits' or pomodoro that appear in
              the 1544 herbal of Matioli. They were the first tomatoes
              introduced to Europe following Hernan Cortes's conquest of Mexico
              (and tomatoes are still known by that name today in Italy). Our
              hypothesis is that these tomatoes will provide superior health
              benefits.
            </p>

            <p>
              Because the health benefits of lycopene are widely recognized in
              scientific literature, it is one of the key compounds we looked
              for in the chemical analysis of our heirloom tomato samples.
              However the all-trans-lycopene present in today's red tomatoes is
              a molecule whose linear structure seems to hinder its absorption
              within the body. This is why we hear recommendations to cook
              tomatoes and combine them with fat, in order to improve our
              absorption of lycopene
              <Reference
                source="Turning up the heat on tomatoes boosts absorption of lycopene"
                href="https://news.osu.edu/news/2008/08/13/lycoproc/"
              />
              . This has always seemed to us to be unusual, given that natural
              food in its raw state is typically better for us, and each stage
              of processing of food does diminish the medicinal quality of that
              food.
            </p>

            <h3>Discovered: tetra-cis-lycopene</h3>

            <p>
              We became aware of studies at Ohio State University and the
              Agricultural Research Service in California on an heirloom tomato
              variety, "Tangerine". These found an alternative form of lycopene
              they call tetra-cis-lycopene. (It is also known as prolycopene.)
              Its structure is more like the lycopene that circulates in human
              blood. Tomato sauces made from red and Tangerine tomatoes were
              tested on volunteers. They found that the tetra-cis-lycopene from
              the Tangerine variety was more efficiently absorbed by the body.
              Further, oxidative damage decreased after eating either of the
              sauces, but the effect was greater after eating the Tangerine
              tomato sauce.
              <Reference source='"Tangerine Tomatoes top reds in preliminary lycopene study": Agricultural Research, February 2011' />
            </p>

            <p>
              This clearly indicates the superior benefit of consuming these
              orange tomatoes containing tetra-cis-lycopene in a cooked form.
              But what about raw? The research has not yet been done to find out
              how tetra-cis-lycopene behaves and is absorbed when eaten as a raw
              fruit. Nevertheless, based on the indicators, we are confident
              that it will be very well absorbed by the body when eaten raw. We
              will endeavour to obtain funding so that this research can be
              done.
            </p>

            <SectionSubheading>Our findings</SectionSubheading>

            <p>
              We now have data on over 300 tomato varieties. We found 12
              varieties with tetra-cis-lycopene ranging from 1.01 to 5.36
              mg/100g FW: all are heirlooms and distinctively orange in colour.
              We used a modern commercially bred hybrid tomato called "Daniella"
              as a control. This is one of the most popular commercial hybrid
              tomatoes in New Zealand and is an attractive red, regular sized,
              firm and prolific tomato. Its levels of medicinal compounds are
              very low!
            </p>

            <p>
              Our research leads us to the hypothesis that traditional Solanum
              lycopersicon tomatoes were originally golden-orange in colour and
              contained tetra-cis-lycopene that is more easily absorbed in the
              human body and therefore of great benefit for human health.
            </p>

            <p>
              We further hypothesise that tomatoes containing tetra-cis-lycopene
              have greater potential to improve human health, in particular by
              reducing the incidence of heart disease and certain cancers.
            </p>

            <p>
              Extensive breeding of tomatoes over hundreds of years has led to
              the recessive gene in tetra-cis-lycopene being progressively bred
              out, replaced by the more dominant all-trans-lycopene we now find
              in tomatoes and red tomatoes in particular. This inadvertent
              consequence of tomato breeding has significantly diminished the
              modern tomato's medical value. It is quite probable that there is
              no modern commercially bred hybrid tomato with this valuable
              tetra-cis-lycopene.
            </p>

            <p>
              We consider the identification of tetra-cis-lycopene and its
              connection to the original <em>pomodoro</em> tomatoes a
              breakthrough in our understanding. From now on we will only grow
              these high-health golden-orange varieties.
            </p>

            <p>
              The challenge we now face is how to maintain or even enhance the
              medicinal qualities of these varieties, without falling into the
              commercial (or perhaps ego-driven) trap of manipulation for the
              wrong reasons.
            </p>

            <SectionSubheading>Competing interests</SectionSubheading>

            <p>
              Our Trust contracts a scientist at a major New Zealand plant
              research organization to carry out the chemical analysis of our
              tomato samples. His attempts to generate some interest within his
              organisation in further research on tomatoes have been
              unsuccessful. He was told there were major commercial barriers to
              the establishment of a 'new' tomato, one being the yield: if a
              variety can't produce 16 trusses of fruit, commercial growers are
              not interested. And even though the research on heirloom tomatoes
              clearly shows that they are superior for human health, they are
              perceived to be less productive and hence not worth growing. This
              of course ignores the quite different requirements of the many
              gardeners growing their own tomatoes in their backyard.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the modern world we have given responsibility for growing food
              over to commercial interests, especially as we have become more
              time-constrained with work pressures, travel times and the
              complexities of modern day living. However as many are now
              realising, modern commercial growers use seeds and methods that
              conform to their specific criteria and needs. Maximising profit
              for business through increasing yields has come at the cost of
              nutritional and medicinal quality.
            </p>

            <p>
              In our view, those breeding tomatoes have been completely unaware
              of the long-term implications of what they were doing. Only on
              examination of the results do we see the foolhardiness of the
              approach taken. It is impossible to quantify the adverse health
              outcomes arising from tampering with a healthy medicinal fruit for
              commercial reasons. If this is representative of the widespread
              breeding and manipulation of our food supply that has taken place,
              then we only have to look around us at the level of ill health in
              society today to see the consequences.
            </p>

            <p>
              Fortunately there is a growing awareness of the need to take back
              responsibility and exercise control over our food supply once
              more. To this end we are very pleased to be members of various
              seed saving organisations and part of this wonderful, worldwide
              reawakening of understanding regarding food. It is indeed
              fortunate that there are dedicated individuals and groups who keep
              the remnants of our heirloom seeds alive, jewels we can turn to
              when these breeding mistakes are eventually detected.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our emphasis on medicinal quality is not new. It is an ancient
              understanding, epitomised by the teachings of Hippocrates: that
              food is mankind's medicine and contains within it all that is
              needed to keep people well.
